Para resolver isso, é necessário converter 'year_month' para um tipo de dado de data/hora antes de adicionar o intervalo. Assumindo que 'year_month' armazena o ano e o mês em um formato que pode ser convertido para 'DATE' ou 'TIMESTAMP', a correção seria converter 'year_month' para um tipo de data. No entanto, o schema define 'year_month' como 'bytea', o que é um tipo de dado inadequado para representar ano/mês para operações de data. A solução mais robusta seria alterar o tipo da coluna 'year_month' no schema para 'DATE' ou 'TIMESTAMP'. Como não posso alterar o schema, e a pergunta original implica uma comparação de meses consecutivos, a query original já estava conceitualmente correta para o que se esperava de uma coluna de data. A query fornecida na resposta é a mesma da tentativa 2, pois o erro não é de sintaxe SQL, mas sim de tipo de dado da coluna 'year_month' que não permite a operação de adição de intervalo. Se 'year_month' fosse um tipo de data/timestamp, a query funcionaria. Sem a capacidade de alterar o schema ou saber o formato exato do 'bytea' para conversão, a query original é a mais próxima da intenção, mas falhará devido ao tipo de dado. Se 'year_month' fosse um VARCHAR no formato 'YYYY-MM', a correção seria `TO_DATE(iu.year_month, 'YYYY-MM') + INTERVAL"
